Create a simple irc server.

**Internet Relay Chat** (IRC) is a text-based chat (instant messaging) system. IRC is designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

Internet Relay Chat is implemented as an application layer protocol to facilitate communication in the form of text. The chat process works on a clientâ€“server networking model. Users connect to an IRC server, which may be part of a larger IRC network.
